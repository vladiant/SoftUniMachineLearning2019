# Introduction to Neural Networks

* Problem statement, motivation and results. Pros and cons
* NN representation
* Perceptron, softmax function
* Two-class and multi-class problems
* Feed-forward NNs: forward propagation
* Chain rule. Backpropagation and learning
* Regularization. Cross-entropy cost function
* NN examples with real data
* Convolutional NNs: ideas, example
