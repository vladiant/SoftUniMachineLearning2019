Dataset Description.

Pointsmapping.ods: 
	A three column spreadsheet (ID,X,Y) which points mapping in local coordinates. 
	Each ID represents an unique place on the map. The X-Y coordinates represents the local coordinates.

For each measure:

measure1(2)_timestamp_id.csv:
	
	Timestamp (Unixtime) of arrival on placeID, timestamp (Unixtime) of departure by placeID, Place ID identifier (0-324)

measure1(2)_smartphone_sens.csv:	

	According to measure1(2)_timestamp_id.csv, this csv contains the data sensors retrieved by the smartphone. 
	Timestamp, AccelerationX, AccelerationY, AccelerationZ, MagneticFieldX, MagneticFieldY, MagneticFieldZ, Z-AxisAgle(Azimuth), X-AxisAngle(Pitch), Y-AxisAngle(Roll), GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ
	
measure1(2)_smartwatch_sens.csv:
	
	According to measure1(2)_timestamp_id.csv, this csv contains the data sensors retrieved by the smartwatch. 
	Timestamp, AccelerationX, AccelerationY, AccelerationZ, MagneticFieldX, MagneticFieldY, MagneticFieldZ, Z-AxisAgle(Azimuth), X-AxisAngle(Pitch), Y-AxisAngle(Roll), GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ

measure1(2)_smartphone_wifi.csv:
	
	Each rows contains PlaceId (ascending order) and 127 column, with RSSI level for each different
	WAPs retrieved during the campaign. Not all the WAPs are detected in each scan.
	For these WAPs, the articial RSSI value is -100 (dbm).
